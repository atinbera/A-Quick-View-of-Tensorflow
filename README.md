# A-Quick-View-of-Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It is used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working within the Machine Intelligence team at Google Brain, and the name "TensorFlow" comes from the way that the library's data is organized.
